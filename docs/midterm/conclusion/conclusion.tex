\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
As expected, increasing the size of the cache and improving the mapping mechanism to cache the entire RAM both improved the performance of the processor. It should of course be noted that this improvement is not always free. For some of the improvements extra RAM blocks had to be added which significantly increased the total area footprint of the processor on the FPGA. In the final processor this will probably not be considered a problem as the main focus of our improvements will be increased performance. Areas of improvement were identified as cache associativity and multiplier speed-up.
