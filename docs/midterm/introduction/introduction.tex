\section{Introduction}
For the Processor Design Project the performance of a Plasma processor needs to be improved.
Before this can be done however, parts of the processor where improvement is possible need to be identified and the baseline performance of the processor needs to be evaluated.
This short report serves as an indicator of the progress made in those areas for the milestone meeting.
First a measurement of the baseline performance of the processor will be done and compared to the performance reported by the project manual.
After that, improvements will be made to the cache and the effect of those improvements on the performance of the processor will be investigated.
Finally, a few aspects of the Plasma processor that will be the target of improvement attempts will be discussed.
In this discussion, improving the speed of the processor will be the main focus.
