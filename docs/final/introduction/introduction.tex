\section{Introduction}
For the ET4171 - Processor Design Project course a basic, functional processor described in VHDL is supplied. The aim of the project is to analyse the processor and find ways to improve it. Specifically, our group aims to improve the performance of the processor and significantly reduce the amount of cycles it requires to execute the benchmarks supplied with the project. This report describes the improvement process of the processor. First, a performance evaluation is done of the unaltered processor to find the baseline for further improvements. This information was also present in the midterm report. Then, the development of a profiler for the benchmarks is discussed and the resulting profiling information is evaluated. This is followed by an explanation of all the improvements that were attempted, both those that succeeded and those that failed. Finally, the performance of the improved processor is evaluated concluding with remarks on the merits of the project result.
