\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
As shown in \cref{ssec:compound-metrics} the preferred design based on the compound metrics is the design with the \SI{16}{\kibi\byte} cache, the improved multiplier and the improved divider.
The second runner up is the design with the \SI{16}{\kibi\byte} cache and the improved multiplier.
The biggest impact was the multiplier large margin.
Many improvements that were attempted didn't work out due to the difficulty or general implementation issues.
They did give great insight into the design process these processors go through, even though only a very simple processor was used.
